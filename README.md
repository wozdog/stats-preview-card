## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I'm starting to get a bit of a process going the more hours I put into the projects. I feel like I still have some work to do with the optimisation side of things. My code could be more efficient with the setting of defaults, and then just updating css as required on individual components.
